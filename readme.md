NewsPublisher is a front-end resource editing and creation tool for MODX Revolution.

NewsPublisher is based on the NewsPublisher snippet for MODX
Evolution but has been completely refactored from the ground up for
MODX Revolution. It includes rich text editing
for the content and summary (introtext) fields and also for any
rich text TVs.
