NewsPublisher Extra for MODx Revolution
=======================================

##Warning: This project is in pre-alpha at this point. Do not install the project on a public web site!##

Because NewsPublisher is in a pre-alpha state, the security checks
are not fully implemented and it might be possible for someone to
edit **any** document on your site via the web if NewsPublisher is
installed.

In addition, files and directories will soon be moving around as the
package is reconfigured for Package Management. You're welcome to
play with it on a local site, but it's probably best at this point
to wait until a Transport Package is available.

NewsPublisher is based on the NewsPublisher snippet for MODx
Evolution but has been completely refactored from the ground up for
MODx Revolution. When finished, it will include rich text editing
for the content and summary (introtext) fields and also for any
rich text TVs. 

The rich text editing function does not work with the current version
of TinyMCE, but should (hopefully) work with future releases.
